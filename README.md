# Color Standards and Color Nomenclature
Converting a 100 year old book into a set of colors and color names.

## Motivation

Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, by Robert Ridgway (1850-1929) was published in Washignton, DC in 1912, it's part of the public domain in the USA. In August 31, 2020 was added to the Gutenberg Project.

The book full title "Color Standards and Color Nomenclature: With fifty-three colored plates and eleven hundred and fifteen named colors" clearly informs about the magnitud and spectrum of pigments, naming conventions and categories embedded in the book.

The end goal is to add the collection to [@meodai's Color Names](https://github.com/meodai/color-names).
